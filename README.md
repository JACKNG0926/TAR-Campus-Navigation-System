The TAR Campus Navigation System is a console-based Java application that 
uses graph data structures to model a campus navigation network. The system 
allows users to manage campus locations (vertices) and pathways (edges) between 
them, providing both textual and visual representations of the campus layout. The 
application implements fundamental graph operations and traversal algorithms to 
help users understand and navigate the campus structure.
